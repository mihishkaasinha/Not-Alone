My parents have always taught me to help the needy. We have always been making donations to Orphanages on special occasions such as Birthday, Anniversary, New Year etc.

</p>

<p size="40" style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;">
We recently celebrated my younger brother’s birthday. Again the discussion came up regarding donation to an Orphanage. Few common questions that have always come up during such times are:
<ul>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">	Which are the good Orphanages present not only in Bangalore but across India? Where are they located?</li>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">	How do I know which of these orphanages are indeed verified and authentic?</li>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">	How many requirements any Orphanage has?</li>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">	How do I Know how much donations an Orphanage has raised in recent times?</li>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">  Where do I see the ratings for these Orphanages?</li>
  <li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">	Is there any Online payment mechanism to make the donations so that I don’t need to visit the Orphanage to make donations?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p size="40" style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;">
  I asked my Father that if we have apps/solutions to discover restaurants, cabs etc. and get required services then why don’t have an app that can help us address the above questions. That’s how the idea of “NotAlone” was born! 
  <br>
  <br>
  We talked to 2 Orphanages in Bangalore and my WhiteHat’s teacher Neha mam, and found that such a solution will indeed be very useful.

<br>
</p>

<p size="40" style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;">
NotAlone is the solution that connects the Orphanages to the Givers. The first version of the solution provides the following functionalities:
</p>

<p>
<ul > 
<li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;" >  <span> Orphanage Registration</span>: Orphanage can register themselves</li><br>
<li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">  <span> Raise Funding Request</span>: Orphanage can raise a request to raise funding based on their requirements. 
  One orphanage can raise only one funding request at a time. Only when a given round of funding is closed, is the Orphanage allowed to raise a new funding request</li><br>
<li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">  <span> View Funding status by Orphanage</span>: Orphanage can view the status of the past and recent funding request using their Orphanage ID ( assigned at time of Orphanage registration)</li><br>
<li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">  <span> User registration</span>: Any User who wants to make contributions to the Orphanages can register themselves</li><br>
<li style="padding-left:0.2em; margin-left: 40px;">  <span> Donation by User</span>: User can view all the Active funding requests ( including Orphanage details) by all Orphanages and make donations for any orphanage</li><br>
</ul>

</p>

<p size="40" style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;">
This is just the start. We have many more exciting functionalities planned to be added in coming versions. You can find more details in the “What’s Next” section.<br>

I hope this solution indeed helps the Needy and make the world a more happy place.
